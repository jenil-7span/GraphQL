npm install -D nodemon
```
- **Nodemon**: nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

- **-D** is shorthand for *devDependencies*. Dev dependencies are modules which are only required during development whereas dependencies are required at runtime.
